# Smart Traffic Flow System Using Simulation ðŸš¦

This project simulates a smart traffic signal system using **Python** and **Pygame**, where traffic lights adapt in real-time based on the number and type of vehicles on each road. Vehicle detection logic determines green signal durations dynamically.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Dynamic green signal timing based on vehicle density
- Real-time vehicle generation and movement
- Simulated intersection with 4-way traffic signals
- Vehicle classes: Car, Bike, Bus, Truck, Rickshaw
- Visual UI using Pygame and audio updates using pyttsx3

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- Pygame  
- pyttsx3

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pygame pyttsx3
